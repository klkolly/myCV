    <h1>Report: Large Coursework </h1>
    <h2>Lingyu Kong</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to
        implement.</h3>
    <p>
        the web is base on an Independent Learner communication club, and the major topic in computer science, we talk
        about what course is better, the new release course, open course source, and roadmap. there are many thoughtful
        talks and good experience from learners.
    </p>

    <p>
        but, the group chat form has its limit :
    <ul>
        <li>not everyone talksthe same topic at the same time, so sometime you will confuse what's the topic he/she was
            talking</li>
        <li>so the thoughtful talk and good experience can only help the limited people in the chat room</li>
        <li>many new learners have the same question, so somebody should talk beginner guide, again and again, the
            better way is they can search for this information</li>
    </ul>
    so the club need a web to for discuss differents topic like "slack" or "Reddit", to communication and convert
    discuss to articles like "medium", and have the search function .
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include guest speakers, other
        websites, artists, developers etc.</h3>
    <p>
        there are MOOCs like Mitocw, Coursera, edx that provide Free Online Courses from Top Universities, but it's more
        like dots, no clear path to some goal.
    </p>
    <p>
        and network of communities based on people's interests web: Reddit, even in Independent Learner communication
        club, there are different topics like jobs, which class to choose or some problems from the course (because many
        free courses don't have official discuss)
    </p>
    <p>
        where expert and undiscovered voices can share their writing on any topic: medium, I like the design medium show
        articles, it's minimal and cleans it makes me calm down and willing to read.
        so the learner can share their experience var article , so it can help more learner
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h3>
    <p>
        proper use of colour and font so the web colour is select from the design web called colorhunt, the main colour
        is kind blue, to make a calm environment.
        the font colour is white when the background colour is blue, it's easy to read. and font family use "Arvo",
        "Noto Sans", easy to read.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keyboard-Friendly : you can easily use keyboard surf through all pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        image accessible: Add proper Alt Text to All Images.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h3>
    <p>
        Navigation Design: it's easy to tap the logo and return to the main page on every page. and the navbar the
        footer nav is the same design
    </p>
    <p>
        Consistency from page to page. a consistent theme, layout, and colour throughout the entire website. the web
        page is in an F pattern.
        black colour in the title, grey colour in additional information
    </p>
    <p>
        Mobile optimization. design website elements where the thumb can reach. decided element visible or hidden for
        mobile or computer.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that
        (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a
        particular resource to make it work with your site). </h3>
    <p>
        learn how to implement Scroll-Then-Fix Content in MainPage, first, there are always "new" article, so on the
        left side, there is article flow, but some old but good article also needs to be shown, and Scroll-Then-Fix
        Content fills the propose, and the problem is I don't know the word "Scroll-Then-Fix", so can't find what I
        want, so I do the difficult way, use chrome to check the element siting, and find when Scroll down, the old
        element display change to "none", and another element show and follow the screen, so next problem is to find
        when to hide, so I choose to use jquery scrollTop() function, and when windows scroll down to the position, make
        hide fixed element to show.
    </p>
    <p>
        rating star function on the review page, when you write a review, there is always a rate function, and the
        rating star should 1) change colour when hover 2) stay light colour when click star 3) post information when
        submitting. so I use youtube to find how others to do this [1] Online Tutorials and reimplement use HTML + CSS +
        Jquery
    </p>
    <p>

        the comment function in article page, to know who is talking to whom it's more clear to show comment in
        different level, and make a bar you can click when you don't want to see this chunk of comments, and Reddit
        doing this, I thought they use something like "list-in-list", but use chrome tools I find they use div in div,
        so first, I design a single comment structure, and then add child comment, after This the next problem is when
        clicking the left bar, to hide all child comment, I use jquery to select the bar element father element to do
        this.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h3>

    <p>
        the road map page is worked pretty well, because a single course is more like a dot, sometime you have to link
        dots into a map to reach the goal, so I design this page, you can add what you have learned, and design your
        path the roadmap and follow the roadmap you know how to reach the goal.
        On this page, you can easily continue what you learning and see clearly what you have finished and what need to
        do next. it's good to have a plan when study.
    </p>
    <p>
        the main page is doing well for show articles, everyone has their own interests, only show popular article don't
        fit for everyone, so I design a slide content that you can choose the topic your interests in, and the site can
        do some back-end work to suit the article topic for visitor. and what I did is use javascript to take the
        article value, transform it into HTML and add the HTML to the main page article. the content can be updated
        easily.
    </p>



    <h3>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</h3>
    <p>
        there are improve can be made to mainpage, when adding article HTML to the page, I just mixed text together, not
        easy to read or change, so use template like mustache is a better way, it's more readable and easy to debug.


    </p>
