          Open University Graduation Ceremony A few years ago, I graduated
          from the The Open University (OU) with a bachelor’s degree in
          computer science. Studying online proved a great fit for me. So
          much, in fact, that I went on to apply to Georgia Tech’s Online
          Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS). I’m currently working
          my way through the program, specializing in machine learning. This
          puts me in an unusual situation: I’ve completed my entire higher
          education online. I suspect that, in time, this situation will</p>

        <h3>Open University Origins & Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          become more common. Unlike most OU students, who are usually in
          their mid-thirties, I joined the OU in my early twenties. I chose
          the OU over a brick university because I had started working full
          time after high school, and I wanted to continue working during my
          studies. Furthermore, I lived in Belgium, but I envisioned my career
          in the US. So I wanted to study in English and my degree to be
          recognized internationally. As it happens, the OU is one of a
          handful of UK universities to be fully accredited in the US. That
          settled my choice. In this article, I retrace my steps at the OU
          from enrollment to graduation. The goal is twofold: (1) to give you
          a sense of what studying with the OU is like and (2) to highlight
          particular aspects of the OU experience that aren’t readily apparent
          from the outside but that every prospective student ought to know.
          Open University Origins & Challenges The Open University is a UK
          public research institution and the world’s first distance-learning
          university. Founded in 1969 following a government push for a more
          accessible higher education, it has grown to become the largest
          academic institution in Europe with over 165,000 students.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          It offers
          courses on a wide variety of subjects and degrees including
          bachelor’s, master’s, and doctorate. In 2012, the OU founded
          FutureLearn, which has grown to become Europe’s largest MOOC
          platform and is now co-owned by the OU and SEEK. Over the years, the
          OU has faced important challenges. Funding reforms in UK’s higher
          education compounded with Brexit led to cuts in student aid, hikes
          in course fees, and drops in enrollments. In 2018, the situation</p>
        <p>
          prompted the OU vice-chancellor to resign, following a vote of no
          confidence from OU staff. The vice-chancellor’s departure was
          precipitated by his controversial plans to lay off staff, cut
          courses, and scale down research. So the OU has and will continue to
          face many challenges. To overcome them, they may adopt measures
          that’ll change its approach to online teaching, perhaps drastically.
          But the purpose of this article isn’t to speculate about the OU’s
          future but to present an account of the OU experience as I lived it,
          and for the sake of future students, as I hope it will remain. Open
          University Admission & Cost “I paid about $1,500 per course and
          $18,000 in total for my degree. But prices have been increasing.” As
          its name indicates, the Open University is built around the notion
          of openness. There are no barriers to entry besides knowing English,
          having internet access, and paying your tuition fees. Given the OU’s
          public, nonprofit nature, tuition fees fluctuate according to UK
          politics. I paid about $1,500 per course and $18,000 in total for my
          degree. But prices have been increasing: currently, the degree will
          set you back $24,000. So the OU isn’t cheap, but it’s more
          affordable than most British universities, and it doesn’t require
          you to shoulder the cost of living in the UK. Open University
          Courses Subjects The Open University offers for-credit courses in
          pretty much every discipline you’d expect from any large university:
          biology, economics, engineering, journalism, law, and mathematics,
          to name a few. Levels Undergraduate courses are classified into
          levels 1, 2, and 3. These roughly correspond to academic years.

          For
          example, level 1 courses are the type of course you’d take in your
          first year in a brick university. They are often introductory
          courses and involve some hand-holding. At level 2, courses are
          likely to build on previous ones, and you’re expected to be more
          self-reliant. By level 3, you’re autonomous and ready to tackle
          semester-long research and development projects. You can take
          individual courses at any level, or you can study toward a degree
          comprising a series of courses across several levels. Availability
          The OU offers courses worldwide, but the exact course catalog varies
          from country to country. As a general rule, most courses are
          available throughout Europe, but options in other continents may be
          more limited. For instance, the OU currently offers about 210
          undergraduate courses in the UK, but just under 200 in the US. Open
          University Degrees Types
        </p>

        <p>
          “Certificates and diplomas can serve as
          stepping stones toward full degrees, reducing the time it takes to
          gain a credential.” Different qualifications allow to accommodate
          different student needs and constraints. At the undergraduate level,
          qualifications available include:

        <!-- list and bold font  -->
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Undergraduate certificate</strong> —equivalent to ⅓ of a bachelor’s degree.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Undergraduate diploma</strong>
            —
            equivalent to ⅔ of a bachelor’s degree.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bachelor’s degree without</strong>

            honours —
            equivalent to ⅚ of a bachelor’s degree.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bachelor’s degree
              with honours</strong>
            — full bachelor’s degree.
          </li>

        </ul>




        <p>
          Similar qualifications are
          offered at the graduate level: Graduate certificate — equivalent to
          ⅓ of a master’s degree. Graduate diploma — equivalent to ⅔ of a
          master’s degree. Master’s degree — full master’s degree. The
          difference between these qualifications isn’t trivial. They don’t
          all benefit from the same level of recognition, especially outside
          the UK. For example, many graduate programs only accept applicants
          with an honours undergraduate degree. Certificates and diplomas can
          serve as stepping stones toward full degrees, reducing the time it
          takes to gain a credential. Finally, the Open University offers
          doctoral degrees including PhD and EdD. Open Degrees OU
          undergraduate degrees focus on either one or two complementary
          subjects. For example, you can pursue a Bachelor of Science in
          Mathematics. But you may prefer a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics
          and Physics. If you decide to study two subjects, you’ll spend equal
          time on each. But the OU also offers an alternative to regular
          undergraduate degrees called open degrees. Instead of focusing on
          one or two subjects, open degrees allow you to pick and choose
          courses to tailor your degree to your needs and interests. The only
          requirement is to take courses across different levels (usually four
          courses at level 1, four at level 2, and four at level 3). But open
          degrees are a double-edged sword. If they offer more control to
          students, they can also be perceived as lacking focus — for example,
          if a student chooses courses that don’t complement each other.
          Moreover, employers are unlikely to know what open degrees are. This
          may not be an issue if you’re studying simply for the pleasure of
          learning, but if your goal is to improve your professional
          prospects, a regular OU degree is your safest option.

          Specializations OU degrees may offer different specializations.
          These are specific fields of study within your degree subject. For
          instance, in computing, undergraduate specializations include:
          Computer Science Software Development Communication and Networking
          Each specialization involves a different set of courses. And while
          some of these courses are compulsory, others are elective — that is,
          you can choose between several alternatives. For example, in the
          Computer Science specialization, taking Object-Oriented Programming
          and Algorithms, Data Structures, and Computability is compulsory.
          But Software Engineering, Data Analysis, and Interaction Design are
          electives — you may decide to take only some of these courses. Open
          University Teaching Method Open University Campus In addition to
          being a distance-learning university, the OU is a research
          institution. Its campus and research facilities are located some 50
          miles north of London in the town of Milton Keynes, also home to the
          famous Bletchley Park. If most OU courses, and by extension, most OU
          degrees are completed online, some require students to spend time on
          campus. This is notably the case for courses that don’t lend
          themselves naturally to an online mode of delivery — for instance,
          because they require direct communication (such as a foreign
          language course) or access to special resources (such as a
          laboratory chemistry course). Rather than not offering those
          courses, the OU decided to add an on-campus component to them,
          requiring students to spend time at Milton Keynes, or at a partner
          institution, to attend classes, take part in practical activities,
          and collaborate. This is also the case for doctoral students, who
          are usually required to live at a commutable distance from Milton
          Keynes to fully engage with the research environment and regularly
          meet with their doctoral advisers. But these cases are the exception
          rather than the rule. The OU remains first and foremost a
          distance-learning institution. Calendar Most undergraduate courses
          are offered twice a year (starting in February and October) and last
          about nine months. Registrations close a few weeks before courses
          begin, and there’s a limit to how many courses you can take at once.
          Maxing out credits each year, you can finish a bachelor’s degree in
          as little as three years, but most students take longer. Open
          University Platform Open University Student Home The heart of the OU
          is its website. There, you can find most of the information you need
          to determine if the OU could be a good fit for you. And if you
          enroll, it’s from there you’ll log into your student homepage or
          Student Home, which centralizes the main components of your virtual
          student life, including your: Profile — where you can access your
          academic record. Newsfeed — where faculty posts announcements. Email
          — which ends in .ac.uk, the UK equivalent of an US .edu student
          email. Calendar — which aggregates all your course deadlines.
          Services — such as career support, digital library, financial aid,
          and help center. Communities — such as OU student associations,
          forums, and social media. Finally, your student homepage allows you
          to access your courses.
